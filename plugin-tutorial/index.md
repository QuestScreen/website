This is a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to build a QuestScreen plugin.
It deliberately does not describe the design of the plugin API in detail; this is what the [Plugin Documentation](/plugins/documentation/) is for.

This tutorial assumes you are somewhat familiar with git, Go, SDL, JavaScript, HTML and programming in general.
It does not try to explain the shown code line by line, rather it describes the general intent.
This should enable you to understand how the plugin API generally works, even if you are not familiar with all technologies used.
You can look up details on what you didn't understand in detail later.
